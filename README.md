At the moment, our app only looks good on the canvas dimension that weâ€™ve selected. If you run the app on screens with different aspect ratios or try to turn it to landscape, the designs will look broken. 

Auto Layout allows us to set rules as to how we want our views to be displayed. Because mobile screens have different resolutions and sizes, we need these rules to tell the iPhone/iPad how it should layout all the elements in the storyboard onto the display. These rules allow our UI elements to be resized and positioned so that no matter which screen they are displayed on, they always look as the designer intended.
